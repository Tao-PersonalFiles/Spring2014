\section{Results from the playtest}
\paragraph{(Author: John Goettsche \& David Klingenberg)}
\paragraph{ Annoying the features of the game (John):}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item pain in the ass to set up and find units
		\item a lot of time checking tables
		\item pieces get bumped out of position a lot
		\item pace was slow
	\end{itemize}
	
\paragraph{How will manual elements be translated? (David)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The map would have to become zoomable and scrolling enabled to accommodate the limited real estate of the computer screen.
		\item Physical elements such as the cards and cardboard unit markers would have to be translated into icons
		\item The dice would have to represent by a random number generator. 
		\item Most of the rules would be automated
		\item Most housekeeping functions, such as advancing the solar cycle, would also be automated
		\item Lore items would be stored in a searchable library.
	\end{itemize}

\paragraph{What parts have to change? (John)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Scenarios can be set up by the computer (optional)
		\item Neutrals can be set up by the computer (optional)
		\item Combat and other random events and their results will be determination by the computer
		\item Phases will be tracted by the computer
		\item General housekeeping will be automated
	\end{itemize}
	
\paragraph{What parts of the manual game can be retained as-is? (David)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The appearance of the map, unit layout, artwork, history, and other lore items could be preserved as is.
		\item The general flow of the game and the rules would be maintained as is.
		\item The primary difference is who is handling housekeeping chores and administering the rules.
