%=========================================

\section{Overview}
\paragraph{The illumination model is used to generate the color/light of an objectâ€™s surface at a given point on that surface. The article presents a new shading model that uses global information to calculate intensities that the traditional models can't deal with.}

\section{Key points}
\paragraph{Conventional Models uses Lamber's consine law as the simplest visible surface algorithms for shaders. Phong's Model is a more sophisticated model, but it has a drawback that has a big side effect on the quality of specular reflections. Another method that modeling an object's environment and mapping it onto a sphere of infinite radius was developed to partially solve the problem from Phong's model. }

\paragraph{Compared to the traditional model, the improved model added the diffuse component, which includes S, the intensity of light incident from the reflection direction, $k_t$, the transmission coefficient, and T, the intensity of light from the refraction direction. }


\paragraph{A tree of rays is used to make the illumination visible to the viewer.}
