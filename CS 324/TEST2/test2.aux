\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Conventional Models uses Lamber's consine law as the simplest visible surface algorithms for shaders. Phong's Model is a more sophisticated model, but it has a drawback that has a big side effect on the quality of specular reflections. Another method that modeling an object's environment and mapping it onto a sphere of infinite radius was developed to partially solve the problem from Phong's model. }{1}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{Compared to the traditional model, the improved model added the diffuse component, which includes S, the intensity of light incident from the reflection direction, $k_t$, the transmission coefficient, and T, the intensity of light from the refraction direction. }{1}}
