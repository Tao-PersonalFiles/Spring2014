\paragraph{This memo shows the process and results of programming assignment 4.}
\paragraph{I'm not quite done this assignment, as the interesting windows issues waste me a lot of time. I  develped the basic 3D modeling system, which all the functions works fine. The drawing of math function and the Rubik's cube are good to go. The drawing of hallway need more work to fit all the doors.} 
\paragraph{Since I don't have enough time, the organization for the code is not very well.}
