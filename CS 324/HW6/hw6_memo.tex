\paragraph{This memo shos the process and results of programming assignment 6.}

\paragraph{Everything works fine: }
\begin{itemize}
\item The graph: is displayed in the correct 3D form
\item Material: have four different one in each quadrant.
\item Default white light: it make DIFFUSE works and all material are displayed in correct color. 
\item Three primary color light: all of them are  made to SPECULAR so there are three spots reflect on the surface.
\item Name and Class Info: are displayed on the screen, but once I scaled the graph the info will be out of the viewport. (That's why only the first graph has the info on the output graph at the second page.)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{The graph looks really awesome when I rotate or move it on testing. Well Done!}
