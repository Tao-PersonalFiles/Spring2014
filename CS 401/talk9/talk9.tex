\paragraph{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item This topic mainly talked about the importance of Computer Science in Advanced Traffic Management Systems. 
\item The Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS) field is a primary subfield within the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) domain. The ATMS view is a top-down management perspective that integrates technology primarily to improve the flow of vehicle traffic and improve safety. Real-time traffic data from cameras, speed sensors, etc.
\item The reason that they need computer scientists are that: it's all about data and communication; we need computer scientists to protect privacy and data security from the traffic.
