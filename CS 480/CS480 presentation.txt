CS480 presentation

Goals for this semester:
1. add animations to let users make more sense about what they get when playing,
like the intercept animation tells you who intercept the ball and will turn the ball to otherside

Also it makes the game look nice and more professional

2. Finish the app
basicly, we want to finish the junior level and publish it to the google store.
We need to add the sounds, 
add the new layout that Aziz gave us at the beginning of the semester
and fix specific details/issues

	-dice are the right size on different tablet

	-ball is located at the right position, 12 fields of the board the ball need to be in the center of the field

	-scoring

	-find any small pieces that can make it nicer and more professional


Where are we now:
1. card and goal animation we get from VTD group

2. We only have goal sound, when we goal 

3. So we added the main menu layout, player level layout, 
we got icons linked to facebook, twitter

4. user experience is just playing junoir to learn the basic operations
also, we got link to some cool video for user to learn the game
