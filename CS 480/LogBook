Group Meeting
learned how to play the games
jordon showed us his work done from last semester, which has already transfered onto andriod paltform

THE APP
Main menu: has "play game" & "exit game"
background:
the app has the board as backgroud. 
play: touch the screen, begin to roll dies and move the ball force to oneside until the defender rolls a double. once the ball reaches the end of one side. the defender rolls die to decide if he catch the ball.
Several cards will be drawed during the play.
After go through the game, I decided to work on that shows the draw card in the middle of the board instead of a new background with the card
That's what I have

2/11
Finally have time to get real start on the project.
Figured out how to open the emulator and import/run the project on emulator.
The emulator runs very slow on my Mac OS. 

Gonna run the project on my windows desktop, seems got some trouble.

2/17 
Still busy, finished most jobs of other courses. 
Still had the trouble on windows. Can't run the kickshot.
Waste a lot of time trying to figure out the problem, but failed

2/22
Emailed Jordan to get some help to fix the problem of android studio on my windows.
One thing is that the Gradle project sync failed.
When I tried to compile the project, it saids Gradle version 1.8 is required, current version is 1.9
Since really unfamiliar with Android studio, gonna do other works and wait for Jordan's responce.


2/23
A free weekend that could work on it.
Then tried to follow the tutorial and learn the basic staff.
It works well for my first app.
Waiting for the response from Jordan, but seems like he's busy. And send me a link about the gradle, followed the instruction and changed the commands in specific file. Still doesn't work. 
Well, funny thing happened. More and more issues came out, and I can't run my first app. Even re-install studio.
Finally, went back on my Mac. Everything works great (I mean, that's the same project, why windows has so many issues...)
Got my new Google Nexus7 tablet, successfully run the kickshot and MyFirstApp on it through mac. 
Just waste a lot of time on WINDOWS!

As I still haven't finish my first task. Tried to search some graphic related tutorial, and learing Creating Custom Views.
